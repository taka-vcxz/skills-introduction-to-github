Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Click Commit changes... in the upper right corner above the contents box. For commits, you can enter a short commit message that describes what changes you made. This message helps others know what's included in your commit. GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice. First, enter Add PROFILE.md in the first text-entry field titled "Commit message".
